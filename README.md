Emotion Detection CNN Project

This repository contains the code for an Emotion Detection project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Introduction:
Emotion detection plays a crucial role in various applications, from understanding human behavior to enhancing user experience in human-computer interaction. This project utilizes CNNs, a type of neural network well-suited for image analysis, to predict the emotions expressed by individuals in images or video frames.

Key Features:

Implementation of a CNN architecture for emotion detection.
Training the model on a labeled dataset of images with different emotions.
Evaluation of the model's performance using various metrics.
Deployment of the trained model for real-time emotion detection.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the training script to train the CNN model on your dataset.
Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation script.
Deploy the trained model for real-time emotion detection in your applications.
